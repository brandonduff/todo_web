Todo File
---

- [ ] Allow undoing particular todos
- [ ] Multi tenancy
    - [ ] Associate notes with session state
    - [ ] Store notes associated with separate notepads for different users, based on session
    - [ ] Allow creation of users. Passwords w/ BCrypt could be fun to figure out (or just start with something insecure)


test list
- 'form_submission' duplication
- make this an application, not a gem
  - basically, remove TodoWeb module and gemspec, replace with Gemfile
- allow setting different text on links than method name
- see about replacing TestCanvas with an intermediate representation with an HtmlRenderer and TestRenderer (or TestDriver)
- allow passing block instead of calling method for form submission/link clicking
